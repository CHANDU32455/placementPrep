As i forgot to organize stuff daywise,. here comes a note for future verification:

started with basics
gone to arrays
gone to some basic problems
then to strings + problems
then to matrices + problems + patterns
then to oos: 
    inheritance
    polymorphism
    encapsulation
    abstraction
    inerfaces

i touched multithreading -- proof of concept: capsytone project :: authenticator..

then to hashmaps etc stuff..
then today at linkedlists...
